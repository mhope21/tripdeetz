# TripDeetz - Flight Status and Reservation Management

## Overview

TripDeetz is a Python application that allows users to retrieve flight status and weather information for a specific flight and date, as well as manage reservations. The application uses external APIs to fetch flight and weather data and stores reservation information in a PostgreSQL database.

## Features

- Retrieve flight status and weather information:
  - Enter the flight number (e.g., AA123) and date (YYYY-MM-DD) to get details about the flight's departure, arrival, and weather conditions at the destination airport.
  - Displays information such as airline, departure airport, scheduled departure time, arrival airport, scheduled arrival time, and flight status.

- Lookup reservations:
  - Enter a confirmation number to retrieve details of a reservation.
  - Search for reservations by date and view a list of reservations made on that date.

- Add new reservations:
  - Enter reservation details, including confirmation number, date, location, duration, reservation type, and web link.
  - Store reservation information in a PostgreSQL database for future reference.

## Prerequisites

Before running the TripDeetz application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- Tkinter (Python's standard GUI library)
- psycopg2 (Python PostgreSQL adapter)
- configparser (for reading configuration files)
- Requests (for making HTTP requests)
- PostgreSQL (a PostgreSQL database to store reservation data)

## Configuration

1. Create a PostgreSQL database and update the configuration file `config.ini` with your database credentials:

   ```
   [database]
   dbname = your_db_name
   host = your_db_host
   user = your_db_user
   password = your_db_password
   ```

2. Obtain API keys for the AviationStack, Airlabs, and OpenWeatherMap services. Update the `config.ini` file with your API keys:

   ```
   [api_keys]
   api_key = your_aviationstack_api_key
   air_api_key = your_airlabs_api_key
   weather_api_key = your_openweathermap_api_key
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script using Python to launch the TripDeetz application.

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Use the graphical user interface (GUI) to perform the following actions:

   - Retrieve flight status and weather information by entering a flight number and date.
   - Lookup reservations by entering a confirmation number or searching for reservations by date.
   - Add new reservations by providing the required details.

## Customization

You can further customize the appearance and behavior of the TripDeetz application by modifying the Python script (`main.py`). You can change labels, button text, and GUI layouts to suit your preferences.
